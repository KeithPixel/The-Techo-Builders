            <h2>Papa on Duty: The Relentless Perseverance of Floro Betonio Jr.</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">By Jeo Denise L. Labiano | Published June 25, 2025</p>
            <p>In a world where quiet efforts often go unnoticed, some stories shine not through grand gestures, but through the quiet consistency of a heart that refuses to quit.
Every morning at the University of Southern Mindanao–Kidapawan City Campus (USM-KCC), a familiar figure stands in uniform, eyes sharp, posture firm—ready for duty. Most students pass by without knowing the weight he carries. For Floro Betonio Jr., being part of the security services team is only one of the many hats that he wears. Behind the calm and smiley demeanor is a man who carries an entire household, a fading dream, and a fire that refuses to die out.
At 41, Betonio is preparing to walk on stage not to inspect the grounds, but to receive his college diploma. As a father who has big responsibilities to fulfill, this is not just a piece of paper, it is a symbol of every night duty after a full day of study sessions and classes. 
Back in 2014, he joined USM-KCC as a man in uniform to support his growing family. Life took an even harder turn when his wife was diagnosed with a mild stroke, leaving him as the sole provider for their five children.
Despite the financial strain and physical exhaustion, he enrolled in college in 2020. He didn’t study to prove something to others. He studied because he believed his children deserved more—and he believed that change starts with example. He had heard the negative whispers about his work, but instead of answering with resentment, he answered with action.
There were days that almost broke him, and it did break him. Deadlines collided with family emergencies, school expenses weighed heavily on already tight finances, energy wore thin, and doubt crept in. And yet amidst all adversaries, support came in the form of people who believed in him, like Chancellor Dr. Ronielyn F. Pinsoy, whose encouragement helped light his path. 
To those who feel that age is a barrier or that hardship is a dead end, Betonio stated that,
“𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘬𝘪𝘯 𝘶𝘯𝘴𝘢𝘺 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘢, 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘬𝘢𝘮𝘰𝘵 𝘳𝘢 𝘫𝘶𝘥. 𝘕𝘢𝘬𝘢𝘺𝘢 𝘨𝘢𝘯𝘪 𝘴𝘢 𝘮𝘨𝘢 𝘯𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘥, 𝘬𝘢𝘺𝘢 𝘱𝘶𝘥 𝘯𝘢 𝘴𝘢 𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘯. 𝘔𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘬𝘢𝘮𝘰𝘵 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘢.”
"𝘕𝘰 𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘮, 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘬𝘦𝘦𝘱 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨. 𝘐𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘨𝘨𝘭𝘦𝘥 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘥𝘰 𝘪𝘵, 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘯. 𝘛𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘥 𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘸𝘦 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥."
Floro Betonio Jr.’s journey is not just about perseverance—it’s about purpose. He guarded more than just the gates of the campus, he stood guard over his family’s future, and he never let it slip from his hands.
As he receives his diploma, the academic success will be louder because of the countless silent sacrifices, the long nights, and the unwavering love of a father who chose to keep going when giving up would have been easier.</p>

            <h2>Dreams and Destiny: The Flames of Al-Francis Jude Rabago’s Courage</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">By Josephine De Guzman | Published June 22, 2025</p>
            <p>“If you can’t change your situation, change your perspective about it.”
Al-Francis Jude Rabago, 23, a graduating student of the Bachelor of Technology Major in Electronics Technology at the University of Southern Mindanao-Kidapawan City Campus (USM-KCC), has always been someone who stood in the shadows of life. Diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, he continues to strive forward with unshakeable fortitude, holding firmly the torch of hope, bravery, and progress.
Cultivating the spark of bravery, he continues to defy his destined journey with dreams, reaching for the peak of light offered by academic success. With the constant companionship of Him, Rabago stays optimistic in seeing the positive side of life, creating opportunities, radiating light, and seeing hope in the clouds of challenges.
𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗡𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲, 𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲
Each of us walks on a unique path, one that is always different from others. Rabago, a firm believer in ‘Everything happens for a reason’, has trained himself to widen his understanding of circumstances and scenarios, stating that, “if you can’t change your situation, change your perspective.”
Rabago is a man of wisdom who radiates inspiration in his every step. He described his journey as a KCCian as one of the most challenging yet fulfilling courses in his life, illuminating the path of virtue with nurtured growth and solidified goals. During the interview, he emphasized how he handled the different hurdles of the university despite his condition.
“Challenging. I know that everyone finds schooling hard and challenging […] my medical condition just made my situation more difficult, but if kaya nila, kaya ko rin. Binigay ‘to sa akin ng Diyos kasi alam niya yung lakas ko […]”.
𝗠𝘆 𝗠𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿, 𝗠𝘆 𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱
Love builds the foundation, while support sustains the core. Raised by a single mom, Rabago has learned early the flair of trials surrounding not just his life’s odyssey, but of his mother. With all the emotional, physical, and financial challenges he and his family faced, Rabago had made a promise for a better future, not for him but for his family.
“I promised to pursue education. To provide, […] and to let my mother have the financial relief even sa gamay ra nga butang kay kabalo ko nga malipay jud na siya nga ang iyahang anak is makatabang na sa iyaha.”
Molded by adversity’s fire, Rabago unlocked doors of understanding towards a lot of things, and among those are the importance of a strong support system in pursuing dreams and education, stating that the principle has been his primary motivation since he started walking with crutches.
“For me, every parent is a hero. […] I always look up jud sa akong mama because she is the only one that’s been consistent sa akoang life […] single mom pero support jud siya sa akoa and sya jud ang una na naga-motivate[…] maong wa jud ko nahadlok […]”
People come and go, yet at some point, people also come up with the conclusion that someone can and will stay despite every other inconsistency. For Rabago, not one person in his life is comparable to how his mom remained consistent and strong, even when he was not, in his life, stating that his mother is his pillar, his strength, and his best friend.
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗪𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗮 𝗣𝗼𝗱𝗶𝘂𝗺 𝗢𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗢𝘄𝗻
In his 4-year stay at USM-KCC, Rabago came to know that friendship is not only a form of entertainment, rather it is a form of companionship and additional support. He shared that the bond he has with his department buddies gave him the confidence to see the light that shined upon his path and to see the potential that accompanies his step.
When asked about how he sees himself after he graduates, Rabago shared that he is looking forward to honing his public speaking skills. He also emphasized that what he wants is for his family to live peacefully and comfortably, mentioning that he aims to make a difference that will be seen beyond his condition.
𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝘀 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗲𝗳 𝗢𝗳 𝗝𝗼𝘆
“ I know that I am different from others and kabalo ko nga lahi-lahi tag gina-agian tanan […] lahi lahi pud tag ways para makasugakod. Kabalo ko sa akong kusog ug kabalo ko saakong kaya nga buhaton. Dili nako gusto […] mag-self pity kay I know na kaya nako buhaton ang kaya pud sa uban, pero in a different manner lang […] wa jud nako gina-compare akong sarili sa uban.”
Never compare your situation to others; it will slowly destroy the pillars of your courage. Growing up, Rabago learned to shift his focus to the things that needed more of his energy, ignoring statements of doubt. He shared that he is also someone who gets hurt by the words thrown at him by the people who bring nothing good to his plate, but instead of dwelling on something that he has no control over, Rabago learned to endure the sting of words and has learned to forge resilience within the hurt, continuing to push forward with his family on his mind.
Al-Francis Jude Rabago’s story reminds us that resilience and bravery are a harmonious blend that will help us achieve our goals. His perspective about life tells us a tale of how limits only exist in our minds, conquering chasms of doubt with his dreams and surviving the odds of crossing the plans of fate.
With less than a week until the 57th Commencement Exercises of USM-KCC, Rabago is eagerly anticipating the declaration of graduates and wearing the cap and gown that will be the testament of his courage.</p>
